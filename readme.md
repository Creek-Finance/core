# Creek Protocol

## Turning Physical Gold into Programmable Finance

We're not just building another DeFi protocol. Creek is a purpose-built infrastructure that transforms physical gold into a flexible, high-precision financial ecosystem.

### The Problem We're Solving

General gold RWA investment is slow, inefficient, and locked in legacy systems. Investors face:
- High transaction costs
- Limited liquidity
- Opaque pricing mechanisms
- Minimal yield opportunities

### Our Solution: Gold as a First-Class Digital Asset

By tokenizing gold through our XAUm standard, we've created a new financial primitive that bridges physical assets with blockchain's programmability.

## Core Tokens: Beyond Simple Tokenization

### XAUm: The Gold Standard Token
- 1 XAUm = 1 troy ounce of physical gold
- Issued and audited by Martixdock
- Fully transparent, verifiable reserve backing

### GUSD: Stability Redefined
A stablecoin that's truly stable—backed by gold, not algorithmic tricks.

### GY & GR: Financial Engineering Tokens
- **GY (Yield)**: Capture gold's economic potential
- **GR (Risk)**: Granular risk management instruments

## Lending Mechanics: Precision Engineering

### Collateral Parameters
- **GR Token**: 
  - Max LTV: 80%
  - Liquidation Threshold: 90%
- **SUI Token**:
  - Max LTV: 50%
  - Liquidation Threshold: 60%


### Risk Management Philosophy
We don't just manage risk—we quantify, stratify, and transform it into a tradable asset.

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/creek-protocol/core.git

# Setup development environment
cd creek-protocol
sui move build

# Run tests (because we're serious about quality)
sui move test --coverage
```

### Contribution Model
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a focused feature branch
3. Write tests first
4. Implement with precision
5. Submit a crisp, clear PR
